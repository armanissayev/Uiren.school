In this lecture, we'll focus on Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and how to choose the right one for your C++ development needs.</div>
                            <div class="material-header">What is an IDE?</div>
                            <div class="material-text">An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development. It typically includes a code editor, a debugger, a compiler, and other features to streamline the development process. IDEs are designed to make the life of a programmer easier and more efficient by providing an all-in-one platform for coding.</div>
                            <div class="material-header">Why Use an IDE for C++?</div>
                            <div class="material-text">C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language, but it can be challenging to work with if you don't have the right tools. Using an IDE for C++ development offers several advantages:</div>
